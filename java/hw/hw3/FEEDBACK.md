# HW3 Feedback questions

(Optional): What new expression or binding did you add? Describe its syntax and semantics.

I added another arithmetic operation, division. The syntax is similar to all the other 
arithmetic operations except the operator is a / (a standard). The operation takes two 
arguments and returns a new expression integer containing the quotient between them. This 
uses integer division. 

(Optional): What adversarial test did you write that points out an ambiguity,
corner case, or likely misbehavior? How would you fix this problem?
