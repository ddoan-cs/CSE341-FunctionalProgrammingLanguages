# HW5 Questions and feedback

## Questions

What difference did you discover between your Java implementation and your OCaml
implementation? Include an example Trefoil program that illustrates the difference.

`LANGUAGE.md` contained a detailed explanation of structural equality to give
semantics to Trefoil's `=` operator. Explain why your implementation of `=` is
correct even though you didn't have to explicitly write a recursive "structural
equality checker" on values.

(Optional) What new expression, binding or pattern did you add? Describe its syntax and semantics.

Describe the substantial program you wrote in Trefoil. What file did you put it in?
